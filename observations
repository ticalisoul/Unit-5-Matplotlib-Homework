#Pyber Observations:
#1) From the bubble plot, we can see that urban drivers get more rides per day, but earn lower fares.
#   More trips but shorter distances
#2) From the pie charts, it seems Urban drivers are competing for rides, while Rural and Suburban drivers
#   have more rides available than drivers
#3) It looks like to maximize profits, drivers should head for Suburban areas as they account for the 
#   highest percentage of total fares while having the least amount of drivers. Less overall competition
#   and higher fares.
